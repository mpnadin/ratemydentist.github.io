     - by price range based on standard service packages
     - by reviews
    
     b. List of contributors and the main parts of the application they will be focusing on.

     - Nadin Puchnina
     - Hüseyin Komaç 
     - Eduard Väli
     - Dmitri Karzikov
 
     c. Framework used to develop the application.
     - bootstrap
     
     d. Target platform(s) that the prototype will run on.
     - online, via browser
     
     e. Guide to installing/running the application (this can be filled out later as your progress with developing your prototype).
     - to use "Rate My Dentist" service, users need to have an internet connection and an up-to-date browser with JavaScript enabled.
     - there are no other requirements, as the service runs through a webpage.
     
 4. Start adding Issues to plan your development activities.
 
     a. Add brief descriptions of what the part of the functionality is going to be addressed by the issue.
     - User (=patient) side of the service - an interface for patients that would include personal user account, search service, booking service.
     - Partner (=doctor/clinic) side of the service - an interface for clinics, where they can upload their info and synchronise visit schedules.
     
     b. Assign issues to specific team members. 
     
     week 1
     - html/bootstrap base for the patient side   -  Nadin and Dmitri
     - html/bootstrap base for the partner (clinic) interface - Manisha and Eduard
